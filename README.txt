## Areas Of Code That Do Not Work As Attended ##
The error messages for the 60 days specification for the search, checkout and
return does not work. This leaves and empty space in the gui below the recommend
section.

The search function could have been updated further so the user can search for
books using different search inputs i.e authors name or genre.

## Areas Of Code That Works More Than Intended ##
The recommends function of my program allows each user to get recommend books
based on what they have previous read. it also account books which have not been
checkout out as well. This allows the user to checkout any book with they are

In addition, the GUI of the of the program uses a single screen which
incorporates all the functions which is required in program. Since no tabs for
changing screens, it allows the librarian easy access to all the function in my
program.

Moreover, i was able to changes in which books are popular in the library. This
is portrayed in a graph and the graph is updated every time someone checks out a
from the library or returns a book to the library.

## Warnings ##
Carefully when checkout or return books in quick succession. this may cause
program to abruptly end.
